# Roblox Dark Enhanced
This is a CSS file for making the Roblox dark theme a little better. Clearly the website guys at Roblox don't know how to make their website better, so here you go.

The stylesheet is based on "Roblox Light Enhanced" originally created by Reselim, but it is out of date. You can check it out on Userstyles here:
https://userstyles.org/styles/154692/roblox-light-enhanced

**THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!!! Please make a new issue if you find any problems, thanks!**

## How To Use
### Prerequisites
Please set the theme to "Dark" on your Roblox account first. I have only made the stylesheet based on their dark theme so far.

To do so, you can go to [here](https://www.roblox.com/my/account#!/info) after logging into Roblox. Scroll down to "Personal" and you should see an option for themes, right above the save button.

You should also have Stylus installed on your browser in order to use the stylesheet. If not, install it at:
* Chrome - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne
* Firefox - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us

### Installation
Once you have Stylus installed, click the link below and Stylus should pop up automatically. From there, you can press the "Install style" button on the left. The stylesheet will be installed to the extension.
